*A standard way of describing DNA damage!*


The Standard for DNA Damage (SDD)
----------------------------------

The SDD is an international collaborative effort to standardise the reporting of DNA damage from computational
simulations. The file format consists of both a header, detailing the parameters of the simulation, and a data section,
detailing the DNA damage (see `Figure 1 <../_static/image/Figure1.png>`_). The format has been designed to encompass the broad
range of DNA damage simulations carried out by research groups in the field. The format can be used minimally, with many
fields being optional, or, as we would recommend, fully with as many fields filled in as the simulation can account for.
Whilst at the point of the SDD paper publication a large proportion of simulation parameters and damage recordings have
been accounted for if further requirements of the standard become apparent the format is expandable to accommodate.
In order to keep the format intact and to avoid ambiguity, if you would like to submit a change to the format you can
do so via the :doc:`Contribute` page. 

For all manuals that use the SDD, we would appreciate referencing the definition paper:
"A New Standard DNA Damage (SDD) Data Format", J. Schuemann et al., Radiation Research, (in print).
